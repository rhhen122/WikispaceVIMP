ESTMATED TIME OF READING: 3:30 MIN

Editor Notes: I spent WAYY to long writing this.

Skills Required:      Basic .HTML Knowledge     Basic .CSS Knowledge      No .JS Knowledge

WikiSpace Is Entirely open-source!

WikiSpace Comes with its own .CSS file! Change this and add to it how you want!

This Guide is designed for People hosting their WikiSpace With https://neocities.org
And Editing it with Visual Studio Code.

First, Make a free Neocities account (The reccomended hoster for WikiSpace!)
Then Individually Drag each file into Neocities.org. (Do this or some files may not work properly!!)
Next! go to "dashboard" and open "index.html"!

Then, Download VS Code [text](https://code.visualstudio.com

The Begineer Level tags (For user unfimiliar with .HTML and .CSS) are tags like &lt;h1> &lt;h2> &lt;h3> and, &lt;p>

You may notice tags that look like this --> &lt;!-- This is a COMMENT tag! Its a place to put text that you dont want showing up on your WikiSpace! -->

If you look on Line 10 of "index.html" you may notice a tag called <body> <-- this tag holds the entire site inside of its perameters!
If you look toward the bottom of the page you may see a </body> tag! This is where the perameters of what users can see on your site end!

Well hold on! What does that / mean? The Slash means the tag ends!
For example, <button> <-- This is a "button" tag! with out its slash counterpart it is going to turn everything typed after it into a button!
But since were in a .MD file it doesnt matter!

Well hold on what does .MD stand for? .MD stands for "MarkDown"! "MarkDown" is a type of coding language! .HTML is a "MarkDown", and so is .CSS!

But wait! Theres More! Wikispace has its own custom tags!!
Starting out with <bigtext> <-- This does exactly what you think it does. It make the text big.
<cur> whatever is writen after this tag will turn into 𝓯𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 text!

Now that you have a-hold of the basics (I hope!) Its time to start editing your WikiSpace!

(Tip: If you dont like the deafult Wikispace-DarkMode .CSS file then there is actually a Wikispace-LigthMode .CSS file!)
(Tip: I reccomend nvim to edit the files for you Wikispace!)
